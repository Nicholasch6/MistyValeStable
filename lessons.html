    <h2>Individual Lessons</h1>
    <p>Whatever reason you want to ride, be it just for fun, competing in shows, or to joust at windmills, we can help you learn how to not fall off your horse while you do it.  You can schedule lessons one at a time, or purchase a block of lessons in advance for a discounted rate.</p>
    <p>Rates for Lessons</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Half Hour Lesson: x monies</li>
      <li>1 month Lesson plan: x monies</li>
      <li>6 month Lesson plan: x monies</li>
      <li>1 year Lesson plan: x monies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Partner Lessons</h2>
    <p>Riding is even more fun with a buddy!  Like a private lesson, but you share the rink with a friend so you can learn to ride together.  It's only the two of you, so you'll each still get personalized lessons from our instructor.</p>
    <p>Rates for Partner Lessons</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Half hour lesson</li>
      <li>Pack of four lessons</li>

    <h2>Group Events</h2>
    <p>If you would like to have a group event that involves horses or riding (like a birthday party), we'd be happy to help!  Please contact us below and let us know how we can help.</p>
